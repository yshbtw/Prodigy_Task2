# Task 02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover relationships, patterns, and trends. The goal of this task is to enhance data quality, explore variable relationships, and identify insights that may be useful for predictive modeling or further analysis.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset Description: The Titanic dataset includes information on passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and survival status. This dataset is commonly used for introductory data science projects due to its rich mix of categorical and continuous variables.

# Approach
Data Loading: Import the Titanic dataset, which includes details on each passenger, such as their demographics, class, and survival status.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values by either filling or removing them. Convert categorical variables into a suitable format for analysis. Correct any inconsistencies in the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate summary statistics to understand data distributions. Create visualizations to explore relationships between variables, such as age and survival rate, or class and survival rate. Investigate potential patterns or correlations within the data, focusing on variables like gender, age, and class.

Insights Extraction: Identify significant patterns, such as which groups had a higher survival rate. Observe trends that can provide insights into passenger demographics and survival likelihood.

# Topics Covered
Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and transforming data as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical summaries and visualizations to explore relationships within the data.

Feature Analysis: Examining variables to see how they relate to each other and identifying key factors that may impact survival.

Insights Extraction: Interpreting EDA results to derive meaningful insights, which can inform further analyses or predictive modeling.

# Usage
Download the Titanic dataset from the provided link on Kaggle. Place the dataset file in the project directory. Run the EDA script to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis, generating visualizations and insights on the Titanic passengers.

# Results
The exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset reveals various insights, such as: The impact of factors like age, gender, and class on survival rates. Relationships between different variables that indicate which demographics were more likely to survive. Patterns in the data that help illustrate the demographics of the Titanic passengers. This analysis can provide a foundational understanding of the dataset, and the insights gathered here can be used to build predictive models or conduct further research.
